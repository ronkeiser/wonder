Read these docs, we're preparing to extend coordinator. Briefly demonstrate understanding.

I want to implement in small chunks, adding events and trace events to give us high visibility, and writing additional e2e tests to validate. Do you understand the point of this approach?

Review the state of coordinator, then recommend the next most sensible chunk.
