**_The CORE PRINCIPLE of our development process:_**

Trace events should tell you everthing you need to know about what is happening in the workflow. If the workflow fails, query the trace events. If you don't see what's wrong, add more trace events. Do not add console.log. Do not make assumptions. Validate your hypotheses with trace events.

YOU MAY NOT GUESS! If you don't know what happened add a trace event or a log. You MUST determine CLEARLY what the problem is from LOGS or TRACE EVENTS. LOGS are only for operational failures, and may apply here. First, show me you understand.
