We recently implemented the fan out and in logic for coordinator in router.ts. It appeared to be working well for a single fan in and out round. So we modified the test to run two sequential rounds: one for ideation, one for judging. However, now the test does not function properly and the workflow output is empty. In my last conversation with an agent, it insisted that we needed to pass a complete json schema to workers AI, so we updated the test. First, look at the cloudflare docs to make sure this is accurate, then report back.
