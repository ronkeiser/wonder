We recently implemented the fan out and in logic for coordinator in router.ts. It appeared to be working well, so we started a refactor (thus duplication of code in synchronization.ts and completion.ts). However, when we were about to refactor router, we noticed that if we increase spawn count and run the test enough times, we'll sometimes get multiple workflow_completed events. Query the logs to see if you can see the results of the last edge test run.
