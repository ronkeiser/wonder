### **_The PRIME Directive_**

We are never here to implement quick fixes or get something working "for now". Everything we do should be an incremental step toward a complete, holistic, robust solution. The current implementation is not authoritative, and neither are the docs. _WE_ are here to define the _ideal_ architecture and make the implementation match.
