**_The CORE PRINCIPLE of our development process:_**

Trace events should tell you everthing you need to know about what is happening in the workflow. If the workflow fails, query the trace events. If you don't see what's wrong, add more trace events. Do not add console.log. Do not make assumptions. Validate your hypotheses with trace events.
