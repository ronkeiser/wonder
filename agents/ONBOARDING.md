Read these docs in order:

1. `README.md` — Core concepts, architecture overview, how workflows execute
2. `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` — Compact requirements summary, keep in context
3. `docs/architecture/structure.md` — Workspace, project, library hierarchy
4. `docs/architecture/cloudflare.md` — Modern Cloudflare guide
5. `docs/architecture/debugging.md` — Using Logs & Events for debugging

Do not read these during onboarding, but take note of their existence:

- `docs/architecture/data-model.md` — Core data types and schemas
- `docs/architecture/execution.md` — Token-based execution, fan-out/fan-in
- `docs/architecture/logging.md` — Event sourcing and observability
- `docs/architecture/error-handling.md` — Error strategies and retry config

Pick the single most interesting thing in the docs and write one sentence about it.
